# LaTeX Standard environment

This repository stores my personal preference in LaTeX design / document structure with all packages and settings set.

To load clone this repository properly, use:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dschemp/latex-standard-env.git
```

### Installation
If you've correctly cloned this repo, you should have a populated "fonts" folder.

For the `tex-document` you will need the STIX2 fonts.

The `tex-beamer` uses the _non-free Flama_ font but this can be switched to _Arial_ in the document.

### Usage
Just start typing in the `document.tex` and compile.
